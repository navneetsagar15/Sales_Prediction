# Sales_Prediction

This repository contains code and data for a sales Prediction project in a retail store setting. Here's what you'll find:

1. Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file):

sales_forecasting.ipynb: This notebook contains the core code for data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
2. Datasets (CSV files):

train_v2.csv: Historical sales data used for model training.
store.csv: Information about the stores themselves.
test.csv (assumed): Unseen data for which sales predictions will be generated.
3. Output (CSV file):

predictions.csv (assumed): This file will likely contain the predicted sales for the test data.
Getting Started

Install Required Libraries:

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install them using pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn.
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing this repository.
Run jupyter notebook to launch the Jupyter Notebook interface.
Open sales_forecasting.ipynb and follow the instructions within for execution.
Note:

This README assumes the presence of test.csv and predictions.csv based on typical sales forecasting workflows.
The actual file names might differ.
Update the instructions accordingly if the file names are different.
Further Exploration

Feel free to modify the code in sales_forecasting.ipynb to experiment with different machine learning models, feature engineering techniques, or evaluation metrics.
The notebook provides a starting point for exploring sales forecasting with machine learning in a retail store setting.
